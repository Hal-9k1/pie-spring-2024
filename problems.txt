Problems:
- Hand "struggling" mechanic doesn't actually work and only appears to work because the motors give
  up themselves.
- Hand uses a magic number to multiply the maximum width.
- Arm easing is broken and disabled.
- Arm bounds checking is broken and disabled.
- All motors that should be 64 ticks per rev appear to be 16 tpr.
  - Possible solution: crack a motor open and count the ticks. Becuase how do we not know this
    already.
- If the robot disconnects from Dawn, the robot receives garbage and must be powered off.
  - Possible solution: a kill button that should never be pressed on the
    gamepad that may be sent if Dawn starts sending garbage.
- It is difficult to adapt to mechanical changes because the implementations of mechanical devices
  in code are tightly bound to the code that uses them.
  - Possible solution: research interface-like design patterns in
  Python.
- Everything about coding has to be FASTER.

Todo:
- Fix problems! (That easy, right?)
- Better simulator. mock_robot is useful to catch syntax and state errors but gives us no
  information about the robot's posrot.
